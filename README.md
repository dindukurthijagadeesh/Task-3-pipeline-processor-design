This project is focused on the design and simulation of a pipelined architecture using Verilog HDL, implemented and tested using the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite. Pipelining is a fundamental concept in digital and computer architecture that enhances the performance of processors by allowing multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously in different stages of execution. The goal of this project was to understand pipelining at the hardware level and simulate its behavior using a simplified instruction execution model. testbench was created to simulate the instruction stream and clock generation. It initialized instruction values, controlled clock cycles, and monitored the output of each stage. Through Vivado's behavioral simulation, waveform outputs were analyzed to track the flow of data and verify correct operation of the pipelined stages.The simulation confirmed that multiple instructions were being processed concurrently in different stages, showing that pipelining significantly increases instruction throughput.
